# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to help!

## Feature requests / bugs
- Please open an Issue describing what you want to change.
- If you're already working on a fix/feature, say so in the Issue so we don't duplicate work.

## Dev setup
- Clone the repo
- Run `docker compose up` (or: `pip install -r requirements.txt` / `npm install`, etc.)
- The app should start on http://localhost:XXXX

## Pull Requests
- Make sure the code actually runs ðŸ™‚
- Keep commits focused on one thing (don't mix refactor + feature)

## Style
- Follow the existing style in the repo. Don't rename everything unless the PR is specifically about cleanup.
